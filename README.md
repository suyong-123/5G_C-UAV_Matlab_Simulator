# 5G C-UAV MATLAB Simulator

This repository provides a **modular and extensible 5G network simulation framework** for connected UAVs, implemented in MATLAB.  
It supports mobility management, scalable UE deployment, and integration with multiple transport-layer protocols (TCP, UDP, QUIC, MP-QUIC).  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is incorporated for intelligent handover decision-making.
